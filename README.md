## My "2 cents"
* RnD of CodeHub; exploring very specific "Edge Auth interceptor" :)
* Min. Win OS SDK : 15063
 
## Setting up the project 
* [Register](https://github.com/settings/developers) your OAuth application. Use "https://example.com/path" as callback url. 
*  After app registation, paste generated key and secret in the `app.config` file in the root of the project.
